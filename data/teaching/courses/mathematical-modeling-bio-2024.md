## Course Overview

This undergraduate course introduces mathematical techniques for modeling biological systems, including differential equations, network theory, and statistical analysis. Students will learn to translate biological phenomena into mathematical models and analyze them computationally.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Formulate mathematical models for biological processes
- Solve differential equations analytically and numerically
- Apply network theory to biological systems
- Perform statistical analysis of biological data
- Use computational tools for model simulation and analysis

## Prerequisites

- **Calculus II** (derivatives, integrals, basic differential equations)
- **Introduction to Biology** (basic cellular and molecular biology)
- **Basic Statistics** (descriptive statistics, probability)
- **Programming experience** helpful but not required

## Course Overview

This course guides IT students from the basics of molecular biology and sequence data through classical bioinformatics algorithms, file formats, and databases, while introducing essential biostatistics and methods for RNA-seq, proteomics, cheminformatics, and structure analysis. It culminates in advanced topics such as enrichment and survival analyses, clustering with multiple testing corrections, and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for sequence, structure, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Formulate mathematical models for biological processes
- Solve differential equations analytically and numerically
- Apply network theory to biological systems
- Perform statistical analysis of biological data
- Use computational tools for model simulation and analysis

## Prerequisites

- **Calculus II** (derivatives, integrals, basic differential equations)
- **Introduction to Biology** (basic cellular and molecular biology)
- **Basic Statistics** (descriptive statistics, probability)
- **Programming experience** helpful but not required
